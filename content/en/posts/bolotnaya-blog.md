**Bolotnaya.online — a blog by a Yakimanka resident built on open-source technologies**  

Bolotnaya.online is a private project created and maintained by a concerned resident of the Yakimanka district.  
The site is not a mass media outlet, and all published materials reflect the author’s personal views.  

The project showcases the capabilities of modern technologies and open-source software:  
- **Nginx** — web server and reverse proxy.  
- **Hugo** — static site generator.  
- **TinaCMS** — headless CMS with visual editing.  
- **Docker** — containerized services.  
- **FFmpeg** — video processing and streaming.  
- **MediaMTX** — live video server.  

Features include:  
- Live HLS streams from cameras.  
- Automated content publishing.  
- Multilingual content support.  

It’s an example of how modern technologies can be combined into a convenient, reliable, and independent blog without proprietary CMS platforms.
